# CPS 261

This is a selection of the homework problems for the Washtenaw Community College class [CPS 261 - Advanced Java Concepts](https://catalog.wccnet.edu/current/courses/cps-261.php) which I took in Summer 2023.

"In this course, students will continue exploring Java concepts. Topics covered include input/output, abstract class and Interfaces, graphical user interface (GUI) associated with JavaFX, data structures, Java Stream, multitasking (Threads) and JUnit. Students entering this class should have a good understanding of object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism."
